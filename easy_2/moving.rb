# Solution 1: Class Inheritance

# Makes sense here, because there is a natural hierarchy structure we can model.

# That said, not all Animals can "walk", so a module is probably best here.
# Clearly, we need to be very considerate when deciding what methods to place
# where, and when to use interface inheritance or class inheritance.
