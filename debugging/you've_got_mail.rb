First we must determine what `send` method is being invoked on `johns_postal_service`.

Since we are dealing with a large inheritance hierarchy, let's view the
`ancestors` of `johns_postal_service` to determine the method lookup order for
`send`:

[PostalService, CommunicationsProvider, Object, Kernel, BasicObject]

Neither `PostalService` nor `CommunicationsProvider` define a `send` method,
so the `Object#send` method is invoked. The argument '860 Blackbird Ln.' is
passed to `Object#send` which thus attempts to invoke a method named
'860 Blackbird Ln.' (which is undefined).

We expected to call the `Mailing#send` method here, so we can include the
`Mailing`module in `PostalService` to provide access to it in the method lookup
chain.

Lesson: Be careful when naming methods -- prefer to name methods that don't
collide with built-in method names (can lead to problems).
